I want the site to be more responsive.
I̶ w̶a̶n̶t̶ a̶n̶ u̶n̶d̶o̶ a̶n̶d̶ r̶e̶d̶o̶ b̶u̶t̶t̶o̶n̶s̶ t̶o̶ b̶e̶ a̶d̶d̶e̶d̶.
I want certain elements to be customisable (Like the Colours, Theme, Font, Text Attributes and many more..)
I want the ability to add Background Music and Images to be added.
I want to add an Intro section which will be a brief intro before the main story itself. The Intro section will also have an option to change the title which will appear on top of your content.
I want to integrate Global Chat system. (I've already tested it and it works. It just needs refinement)
I want to add a Global Gallery where people can put on their stories with customisable Thumbnails.
I want a lock and a credits for the story in which once you are finished with the story, you may lock the story and put it up in the Global Gallery so that the story can not be changed or plagarised and so that you're credited for your work.
Many of these systems are complex and backend (which I can't do, yet..) so It may require some time to be added if the page doesn't lose my interest.
