Talescaper is a project which I've worked on for just a little while. I used the help of various AI LLMs to help me code. The main one was Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Ofcourse, I used some of my knowledge to refine and fine-tune certain elements but most of the coding work done was done by AI. I did bugfixing, prompts for the coding, structure of the page and a lot of itterations to get it when it is now. Right now, I am hosting the page from GitHub pages without any domain name, but soon I will once I'm satisfied enough with the project. I want to do addition and to fix certain features, after which I can say that I'm satisfied with the site.

I want the site to be more responsive.
I want an undo and redo buttons to be added. (done)
I want certain elements to be customisable (Like the Colours, Theme, Font, Text Attributes and many more..)
I want the ability to add Background Music and Images to be added.
I want to add an Intro section which will be a brief intro before the main story itself. The Intro section will also have an option to change the title which will appear on top of your content.
I want to integrate Global Chat system. (I've already tested it and it works. It just needs refinement)
I want to add a Global Gallery where people can put on their stories with customisable Thumbnails.
I want a lock and a credits for the story in which once you are finished with the story, you may lock the story and put it up in the Global Gallery so that the story can not be changed or plagarised and so that you're credited for your work.
Many of these systems are complex and backend (which I can't do, yet..) so It may require some time to be added if the page doesn't lose my interest.
