About Me: 
I’m Piyush Bhardwaj, A 15-year-old lad from New Delhi who just got into coding. I’ve known basic HTML and CSS since I was 12 but I started it taking seriously just recently. Web Development is just one of my hobbies. I am a self-proclaimed economist and am really into Politics, Geo-Politics, Technology, Science and Artificial Intelligence.

Acknowledgement:
Being an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, pretty much everything on this page is done with the help of AI LLMS. And I made this page just 1-2 days before my Maths exams.

Projects: I pretty much made random incomplete things for fun before this.

The following list is provided for potential future updates and/or for others to contribute to this project: 
•I want this page to be more responsive and easier to work with in mobile devices.
•I want Undo and Redo buttons to be added with their keyboard shortcuts.
•I want certain elements to be customisable within this page (Like Colours, Customisable Themes, Different Fonts, Text Attributes along with many other elements)
•I want the ability to add Background Music and SFX.
•The ability to add Images as Illustrations for the story is also to be added.
•I want to add an Intro section which will be a brief intro before the main story itself. The Intro Editor will also have an option to change the title which will appear on top of your content.
•I want to integrate a better Global Chat system. (Try it at: https://cybergeek121.github.io/Talescraper)
•I want to add a Global Gallery system where people can put on their stories in a Gallery section for others to see online with the ability to customise Thumbnails, Titles and provide Descriptions.
•In story creator mode, I want a toggle lock option which allows you to set a password for your story. This password is required to further edit the story. If you do not have the password for a locked story, you can’t edit it to plagiarize. This makes more sense with the implementation of Global Gallery where your story is public. Also, you cannot download JSON file of a locked story without knowing the password.
